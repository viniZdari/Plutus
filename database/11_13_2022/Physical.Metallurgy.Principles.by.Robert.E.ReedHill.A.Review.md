# Physical Metallurgy Principles by Robert E. Reed-Hill: A Review
 
Physical Metallurgy Principles is a textbook that covers the fundamental concepts and applications of physical metallurgy. The book was written by Robert E. Reed-Hill, a professor of metallurgical engineering at the University of Florida. The book was first published in 1964 and has been revised and updated several times since then. The latest edition was published in 1992 and co-authored by Reza Abbaschian, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Riverside.

The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic principles of physical metallurgy, such as atomic structure, bonding, crystal structure, defects, diffusion, phase diagrams, and phase transformations. Part II deals with the mechanical behavior of metals, such as elasticity, plasticity, fracture, fatigue, creep, and stress corrosion cracking. Part III covers the physical properties of metals, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, magnetic properties, optical properties, and corrosion resistance. Part IV discusses the applications of physical metallurgy to various engineering materials, such as steels, cast irons, nonferrous alloys, ceramics, composites, and superalloys.
 
The book is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of metallurgy and materials science, as well as for practicing engineers and researchers who want to refresh their knowledge of physical metallurgy. The book provides a comprehensive and balanced coverage of both theory and practice, with numerous examples, problems, tables, figures, and references. The book also includes appendices that contain useful data and formulas.
 
Physical Metallurgy Principles is a classic and authoritative text that has been widely used and cited in the field of physical metallurgy. The book is available for free download from the Internet Archive[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. However, readers should be aware that the book may be outdated in some aspects and may not reflect the latest developments and innovations in physical metallurgy.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Physical Metallurgy Principles
 
Physical Metallurgy Principles has many advantages as a textbook and a reference book for physical metallurgy. Some of the advantages are:
 
- It covers a wide range of topics and concepts in physical metallurgy, from the fundamentals to the applications.
- It explains the theory and practice of physical metallurgy in a clear and concise manner, with examples and illustrations.
- It provides many problems and exercises for students to test their understanding and apply their knowledge.
- It includes appendices that contain useful data and formulas for physical metallurgy.
- It is available for free download from the Internet Archive.

However, Physical Metallurgy Principles also has some disadvantages that readers should be aware of. Some of the disadvantages are:

- It may be outdated in some aspects and may not reflect the latest developments and innovations in physical metallurgy.
- It may not cover some topics or concepts that are relevant or important for modern physical metallurgy.
- It may not provide enough depth or detail on some topics or concepts that require more explanation or analysis.
- It may not include some references or sources that are more recent or reliable for physical metallurgy.
- It may not be compatible with some formats or devices for reading or printing.

Therefore, readers should use Physical Metallurgy Principles with caution and discretion, and supplement it with other books or resources that are more current and comprehensive on physical metallurgy.
