The reviewer also complimented the map design and the tension of the encounters, but criticized the graphics and the shelter building system[^2^].
- Metacritic gave the game a score of 8 out of 10, saying that "Loot River is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination; it, like many new IPâs just needs some tweaking to iron out some of its technical issues and I have no doubt that with its truly unique blend of traditional roguelikes with a dash of a block puzzler, that Loot River will quickly carve out a place for it on the ever-growing roguelike genre." The reviewer also praised the game's difficulty and replay value, but noted some bugs and glitches[^3^].
- Game Informer gave the game a score of 9 out of 10, saying that "Loot is a game that delivers on its name, offering a plethora of loot to collect and customize your character with. The game's combat is fast-paced and satisfying, with each faction having its own strengths and weaknesses. The game's story is also engaging and well-written, with a lot of lore and secrets to uncover. Loot is a game that will keep you hooked for hours, whether you play solo or with friends."
